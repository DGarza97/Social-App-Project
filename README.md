# Social-App-Project
App that allows you to find a project or project ideas to work with people on

## Description
Computer Science majors have been known to be more introverted than the average person. This type of personality type can make it quite hard to work in the computer science field where teamwork and general work with others is highly stressed by everyone in the field. This is especially needed when one needs to build a portfolio of coding projects to use in the future for resumes. 

This app is a social life app that is an app for said people and is also geared towards those either working towards a computer science degree or those who just recently graduated with one. The general idea is that those who are either looking for people to work on a project or those who are looking to work on a project have a central space in which they can find others. Those searching for others would be able to make posts about an ongoing project or project idea and that post would appear on the feed of users looking to participate in projects. And likewise, anyone searching for a project or project idea to work on would be able to scroll through their feed and find projects they might find interesting to participate in. 

## CRUD Convention
This app follows the CRUD convention in the following ways:

### C (Create)
Users can create an account and use that account to either further create posts that contain project ideas or ongoing project information. These posts can give an overall picture of the project and tell other users what they may need to know to work on the project.

### R (Read)
Users can read through a feed of posts that tell of different projects that they can participate or express interest in. These posts can be filtered through based on interests or requirements for the user. 

### U (Update)
If enough developers for a project are found, the creator of the project or project idea can then update the post as necessary. Updates can also be done if things change throughout the project such as number of people needed or skills necessary.

### D (Delete)
Once a project is finished or if enough people have been gathered for a project, users can easily and swiftly delete a post that is no longer needed. This will prevent others from accidentally joining a team where all spots are filled.

## Agile Planning

This project uses Agile planning to help manage development in small, flexible steps instead of trying to build everything at once. Agile is useful for making sure the project stays on track, can adapt to changes, and stays focused on what users need.

### How Agile is Used in This Project:

- **User Stories**: Features are described as short stories from the user's point of view to make sure development stays focused on real needs.

- **Sprints**: Work is divided into small time periods (like 1â€“2 weeks), where a few tasks or features are completed and reviewed.

- **Task Prioritization**: Features and bugs are listed and sorted by importance so the most valuable parts get built first.

- **Feedback and Adjustments**: After each sprint or round of development, feedback is used to improve the app.

- **Collaboration**: Tasks are discussed, and decisions are made together to keep everyone aligned and productive.

### Example User Story
As a user looking for a project, I want to search or filter project posts so I can quickly find ones that match my interests and skills.
