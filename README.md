# Social-App-Project
App that allows you to find a project or project ideas to work with people on

## Description
Computer Science majors have been known to be more introverted than the average person. This type of personality type can make it quite hard to work in the computer science field where teamwork and general work with others is highly stressed by everyone in the field. This is especially needed when one needs to build a portfolio of coding projects to use in the future for resumes. 

This app is a social life app that is an app for said people and is also geared towards those either working towards a computer science degree or those who just recently graduated with one. The general idea is that those who are either looking for people to work on a project or those who are looking to work on a project have a central space in which they can find others. Those searching for others would be able to make posts about an ongoing project or project idea and that post would appear on the feed of users looking to participate in projects. And likewise, anyone searching for a project or project idea to work on would be able to scroll through their feed and find projects they might find interesting to participate in.
